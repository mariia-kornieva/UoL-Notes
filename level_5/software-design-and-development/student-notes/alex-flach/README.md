# Software Design and Development Course Notes

These notes are largely summaries and extracts from various textbooks on the topics covered in the module. 

Some of the course videos and articles assigned as reading are also summarised.

The topics covered in the module and notes are:

***Topic 1: Software Architecture*** 

Notes in [architecture.md](architecture.md). Main topics are module coupling and cohesion with some preliminaries on architecture.

Language features are in [languages.md](languages.md#modularity)

***Topic 2: Developer Testing***

Notes in [testing.md](testing.md). Developer testing strategy, Test Driven Development. There are not many notes on TDD as I don't like it.

Some short notes on language implementation in [languages.md](languages.md#unit-testing)

***Topic 3: Defensive Programming***

Notes in [defensive.md](defensive.md). Covers use of assertions, exceptions, security engineeering and debugging.

Lots of notes on language details in [languages.md](languages.md)

***Topic 4: Requirements and Quality Assurance***

Notes in [requirements.md](requirements.md). Include usability and accessibility.

The stuff on testing process is in [testing.md](testing.md#test-procedure-templates) with the other testing notes.

***Topic 5: Version Control with Git***

Notes in [git.md](git.md). Notes are just extracts from the Git book on the topics covered in the module.
